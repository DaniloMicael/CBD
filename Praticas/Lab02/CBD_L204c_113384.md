`Note: The metrics presented are the median results from multiple experiments where a limit is imposed on the number of units requested, based on exercises 2.4(b) and 1.5(b).`

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Redis and MongoDB

### Redis:

- **Advantages:**
    1. Extremely fast for both read and write operations due to its in-memory nature.
    2. Ideal for scenarios requiring real-time processing, such as rate limiting, caching, and session management.
    3. Low latency, making it highly suitable for operations that demand speed (as evidenced by the faster read times in the table).
- **Disadvantages:**
    1. Limited to smaller datasets that fit into memory, which could be a bottleneck for applications requiring large-scale data storage.
    2. Data persistence is optional and can be less reliable, as it might not fully recover after a system failure without proper configurations.

### MongoDB:

- **Advantages:**
    1. Supports larger datasets with high scalability, suitable for more complex queries and data storage.
    2. Designed for high availability with built-in replication and horizontal scaling (sharding).
    3. Better suited for applications needing long-term data persistence with richer document-based queries.

- **Disadvantages:**
    1. Slower read and write operations compared to Redis, as shown in the metrics.
    2. While it is versatile, the performance may degrade under heavy load without proper optimization or indexing.

## Which one is the best in this scenario?

- For this specific use case, `Redis` would be the more appropriate choice due to its faster performance, especially in scenarios where quick read/write operations and real-time data processing are essential, such as limiting the number of units requested by a user in a given time window. MongoDB, while slower in comparison, offers greater flexibility and durability, making it better suited for applications requiring more complex data models and long-term persistence.
- In this case, since we prioritize speed over data complexity or persistence, Redis is the better solution.
